# Tutorial example

Use this example to write Terra docs tutorials. 

# Title <!--- All headings use sentence-style capitalization -->

<!--- provide a 2-4 sentence overview of the tutorial here. -->
In this tutorial, you will learn how to organize and write a tutorial. 

## Prerequisites

<!--- leave a blank line between all headings, blocks, and new paragraphs or lines. -->

- All dependencies needed to complete the tutorial should be listed here. 
- [Link](any necessary downloads)
- [Install application](link to app download page)
- [Dowload dependency](link to dependency download instructions)

## 1. Headers denote sections, like "Initial setup." If these sections need to be done in a specific order, number them. 

You can place a brief 1-2 sentence overview of this section here.

1. If a section contains more than one step to complete, break up the steps into their granular substeps and number them.  

<!--- leave a blank line between numbered list items. -->

2. Steps should include an action. Be direct and keep directions clear and succinct. Avoid long paragraphs. Remember, tutorials are instructions to achieve a goal. They are action-oriented. 

   :::{admonition} Most admonitions should have a custom title
   :class: note

   Admonitions should be used for notes, warnings, or dangers. Change the class to the appropriate admonition type. 
   <!--- Code blocks or admonitions between numbered steps need to be indented using 3 spaces. Do not use tab. Otherwise, the numbers will start over after the code block.  -->

   :::

3. 

## 2. Write a code block <!--- Keep heading steps action-oriented if numbered, and avoid "-ing" endings.  -->

Put text here to describe this code block. 

<!--- This step has no sub-steps, so the code block is not indented with 3 spaces, and there is no numbered list.  -->

``` sh <!--- Always label language. -->
cd file <!--- Avoid writing notes here unless the code block is very long. Include all necessary info above the code. -->
npm install <!--- Users should be able to copy and paste any codeblock directly into their terminal as-is. -->

```

<!--- don't start code blocks with $. -->

Put text here to describe the terminal output if necessary. 

### Level three headings denote subcategories of main categories

<!--- Try not to use more than 3 levels of headings. -->

Open the following code in a code editor:

``` go 
If a code block denotes a file snippet, make that clear.
```
