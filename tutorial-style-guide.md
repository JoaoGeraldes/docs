# Tutorial style guide

Tutorials are guides that walk users through specific actions to achieve a goal. 

Tutorials should start from scratch. Tutorials should teach the basics of getting started, and include one real-world example of a specific action. 


## Writing stytle

Tutorials are written in inviting and clear language. Tutorials should include the necessary information to help a user achieve a specific task. Tutorials start from the begining, and do not assume prior knowledge of the subject. 

Tutorials are action-oriented. Try not to include 

## Voice

All writing in the Terra docs is written in second or third person. First person language such as "I," "we," "us," or "let's" should be avoided in all situations. 

## Prerequisites

The prerequisite section should be at the top of the tutorial. This section should include all relevant dependencies necessary for completing the tutorial. 

## Titles

Titles are written using sentence-style capitalization. The first word of a title is always capitalized. Avoid using gerunds in titles. 

**Example**: 
"# Starting The LCD" 
becomes 
"# Start the LCD" 

## Code

Code should be in blocks. A command that a user needs to execute should be written in a code block rather than inline. Use `inline code` to refer to specific parts of code. 

**Example**:  Use the `start` command to run the application:

```sh
npm start
```

Use notes in code blocks sparingly. Most notes should be written above the code block. Anotations should be rederved for long code blocks. Code blocks in tutorials should be writtwen so that a user can copy and paste directy into their terminal using the copy button on each code block. 

### Inline code

Code mentioned outside of code blocks should always be writen in tick marks exactly as it appears.

**Example**:  

Use the `k.FunctionExapmle` function to create an example. 

Avoid starting sentences with code, as it makes capitalization and puctiation difficult. Never alter the punctuation or capitalization of code. Write it exactly as it appears. 

**Example**:  

All code goes inside `tick` marks, even when referring to specific `variables`.

## Examples

Examples are denoted in the following format:

**Example**: You can put a short intro to the example here. 

This is an example. 

## Lists

### Ordered lists

### Unordered lists

## Text styles

Don't use italics. Bold is used in the following cases:

- When referring to interface buttons. "Click **Send**."
- When denoting [examples](#examples). 

Note: punctuation is never styled.

## Links

Use descriptive text for links. Avoid using "here" as a placeholder.  

**Example**:

"For mor examples, visit the [example page](example.com). 
vs. 
"For more examples, click [here](example.com)." 

Descriptive links helps the user understand where they are going when they click the link. 

## Punctuation

Simplify your writing. While tempting, em dashes promote unecessary complexity and ambiguous grammar. 

Punctuation integral to a sentence should never be styled or included in a link.

**Example**:

Period outside of link: 
"Visit the [example page](example.com). "
vs 
Comma outside of code: 
"The three commands are `start`, `end`, and `help`. 


Use the Oxford comma.
