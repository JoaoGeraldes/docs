## Are exchanges excluded from the whale cap?

Exchanges cannot be excluded from the whale cap. The genesis of Terra 2.0 will be generated programmatically by each validator using on-chain, verifiable data, which means there's no way for them to verify individual balances of users on an exchange. 

## Is bonded LUNA included in the post-attack LUNA snapshot?

Yes, along with liquid staking derivatives.
