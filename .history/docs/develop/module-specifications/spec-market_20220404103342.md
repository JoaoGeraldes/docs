## Overview

The market module is the heart of the Terra protocol, allowing users to always trade 1 USD of Terra for 1 USD of Luna. This simple mechanism ensures the price-stability of Terra stablecoins on external markets by incentivizing trades that maintain each stablecoin's price peg. Whenever Terra stablecoins are trading above or below the prices of their fiat counterparts, an arbitrage opportunity is created. Traders are incentivized to rebalance pools in external markets by profiting from the arbitrage trades against the market module. 



## Exchange rates

Validators import the real-time value of Luna against various fiat currencies using oracle feeders. Validators use these prices to calculate the exchange rates of Luna against each Terra stablecoin's fiat counterpart. Oracle exchange rates are listed as fiat amount per Luna. For example, if 1 Luna is trading at 100 USD, the rate would be reported as 100 USD/Luna. Validators submit these rates as votes, and the weighted median rates for each stablecoin are determined to be the effective exchange rates used by the Terra protocol in the market module. This process happens every 6 blocks. 

When a trader wants to swap between Luna and Terra stablecoins, or exchange between stablecoin denomination, the current exchange rates are directly imported from the oracle module. 

:::{note}
On-chain, the Terra protocol makes no distinction between fiat denominations and their stablecoin counterparts. In the oracle module, validators submit the exchange rates of fiat against Luna. The market module then uses these fiat/Luna rates as the effective price rates for Terra stablecoins. The market module never requires the off-chain exchange rate between fiat and Terra stablecoins to calculate swaps. For this reason, 1 UST is always equal to the price of 1 USD on-chain, regardless of external market conditions.

## Swaps

The market module is responsible for swaps between Terra stablecoin denomintions and swaps between Terra stablecoins and Luna. 


### Stablecoins 

To swap between stablecoins, 

### Terra and Luna

### Swap Procedure

The swap procedure logic can be found in [x/market/keeper/msg_server.go](https://github.com/terra-money/core/blob/main/x/market/keeper/msg_server.go). 

1. The Market module receives a [`MsgSwap`](#msgswap) message and performs basic validation checks using `ValidateBasic`. 

2. [`k.ComputeSwap()`](#functions) is called, and the oracle exchange rate is used to calculate the equivalent amount of the ask coin from the offer coin.

3. The Spread fee or Tobin tax is calculated and subtracted from the ask amount. 

4. The offer and ask amounts (minus the fee) are applied to the virtual pools, and the `TerraPoolDelta` is updated with [`k.ApplySwapToPool()`](#k-applyswaptopool).

5. The `offerCoin` is transfered to the market module using `k.BankKeeper.SendCoinsFromAccountToModule()`.

6. The `offerCoin` is burned using `k.BankKeeper.BurnCoins()`.

7. The ask amount and spread fee are minted separately using `k.BankKeeper.MintCoins()`.

8. The newly minted askCoins are sent to the trader using `k.BankKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount()`.

9. The swap fee is sent to the oracle account using `k.BankKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToModule()`. 

10. The `swap` event is emitted to publicize the swap and record the spread fee.

:::{note} If a trader's `Account` has insufficient balance to execute a swap, the transaction will fail.

## Concepts


### Swap Fees

Because Terra's price feed is derived from validator oracles, a delay exists between the price reported on-chain and the real-time price.

The delay lasts around one minute (our oracle `VotePeriod` is 30 seconds), which is negligible for nearly all practical transactions. However, front-running attackers could take advantage of this delay and extract value from the network.

To defend against this type of attack, the Market module enforces the following swap fees:

- [**Tobin tax**](#tobintax) for spot-converting Terra<>Terra swaps

  For example, assume that the current Tobin tax for KRT is 0.35%, the oracle reports that the Luna<>SDT exchange rate is 10 and the Luna<>KRT exchange rate is 10,000. Swapping 1 SDT would return 0.1 Luna, which is 1,000 KRT. After the Tobin tax is applied, you will have 996.5 KRT (0.35% of 1,000 is 3.5), a better rate than any retail currency exchange and remittance[^1].

[^1]: Initially, the Terra blockchain maintained a policy for zero-fee swaps. However, to prevent front-running attackers from exploiting the exchange-rate latency and profiting at the expense of users, the Tobin tax was implemented. For more information, see ["On swap fees: the greedy and the wise"](https://medium.com/terra-money/on-swap-fees-the-greedy-and-the-wise-b967f0c8914e).

- [**Minimum spread**](#minspread) for Terra<>Luna swaps

  The minimum spread is 0.5%. Using the same exchange rates as above, swapping 1 SDT will return 995 KRT worth of Luna (0.5% of 1000 is 5, which is taken as the swap fee). If you reverse the direction of the swap, 1 Luna would return 9.95 SDT (0.5% of 10 is 0.05), or 9,950 KRT (0.5% of 10,000 = 50).


### Market Making Algorithm

Terra uses a Constant Product market-making algorithm to ensure liquidity for Terra<>Luna swaps. [^2]

[^2]: For a more in-depth treatment of our updated market-making algorithm, check [Nick Platias's SFBW 2019 presentation](https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-stability-swap-mechanism-deep-dive-at-sfbw/135).

With Constant Product, a value, $CP$, is set to the size of the Terra pool multiplied by a set **fiat value of Luna**, and ensure our market-maker maintains it as invariant during any swaps by adjusting the spread.

::: {note}
The Terra blockchain's implementation of Constant Product diverges from Uniswap's, as the fiat value of Luna is used instead of the size of the Luna pool. This nuance means changes in the price of Luna does not affect the product, but rather the size of the Luna pool.
:::

$$CP = Pool_{Terra} * Pool_{Luna} * Price_{Luna}$$

For example, start with equal pools of Terra and Luna, both worth 1000 SDR total. The size of the Terra pool is 1000 SDT, and assuming the price of Luna<>SDR is 0.5, the size of the Luna pool is 2000 Luna. A swap of 100 SDT for Luna would return around 90.91 SDR worth of Luna (≈ 181.82 Luna). The offer of 100 SDT is added to the Terra pool, and the 90.91 SDT worth of Luna are taken out of the Luna pool.

```
CP = 1000000 SDR
(1000 SDT) * (1000 SDR of Luna) = 1000000 SDR
(1100 SDT) * (909.0909... SDR of Luna) = 1000000 SDR
```

This is meant to be an example. In reality, liquidity pools are much larger, diminishing the magnitude of the spread.

The primary advantage of Constant-Product is that it offers “unbounded” liquidity, and swaps of any size can be serviced.

### Virtual Liquidity Pools

The market starts out with two liquidity pools of equal sizes, one representing all denominations of Terra and another representing Luna. The parameter [`BasePool`](#basepool) defines the initial size, $Pool_{Base}$, of the Terra and Luna liquidity pools.

Rather than keeping track of the sizes of the two pools, this information is encoded in a number $\delta$, which the blockchain stores as `TerraPoolDelta`. This represents the deviation of the Terra pool from its base size in units µSDR.

The size of the Terra and Luna liquidity pools can be generated from $\delta$ using the following formulas:

$$Pool_{Terra} = Pool_{Base} + \delta$$
$$Pool_{Luna} = ({Pool_{Base}})^2 / Pool_{Terra}$$

At the [end of each block](#end-block), the market module attempts to replenish the pools by decreasing the magnitude of $\delta$ between the Terra and Luna pools. The rate at which the pools will be replenished toward equilibrium is set by the parameter [`PoolRecoveryPeriod`](#poolrecoveryperiod). Lower periods mean lower sensitivity to trades: previous trades are more quickly forgotten and the market is able to offer more liquidity.

This mechanism ensures liquidity and acts as a low-pass filter, allowing for the spread fee (which is a function of `TerraPoolDelta`) to drop back down when there is a change in demand, causing a necessary change in supply which needs to be absorbed.


### Seigniorage

::: {admonition} All seigniorage is Burned
:class: Caution

Seigniorage used to be an important part of the protocol, but is no longer necessary. As of Columbus-5, all seigniorage is burned, and the community pool is no longer funded. Swap fees are used instead of seigniorage as ballot rewards for the exchange rate oracle. The following information is kept as reference:
:::

When Luna swaps into Terra, the Luna recaptured by the protocol was called seigniorage -- the value generated from issuing new Terra. The total seigniorage at the end of each epoch was calculated and reintroduced into the economy as ballot rewards for the exchange rate oracle and to the community pool by the Treasury module, described more fully [here](spec-treasury.md). As of Columbus-5, all seigniorage is burned, and the community pool is no longer funded. Swap fees are used as ballot rewards for the exchange rate oracle.

## State

### Terra Pool Delta δ

- type: `sdk.Dec`

 This represents the difference between the current Terra pool size and its original base size, valued in µSDR.

## Message Types

### MsgSwap

A `MsgSwap` transaction denotes the `Trader`'s intent to swap their balance of `OfferCoin` for a new denomination `AskDenom`. Terra<>Terra swaps incur gas and the Tobin tax, and Terra<>Luna swaps incur gas and a spread fee.

```go
// MsgSwap contains a swap request
type MsgSwap struct {
	Trader    sdk.AccAddress `json:"trader" yaml:"trader"`         // Address of the trader
	OfferCoin sdk.Coin       `json:"offer_coin" yaml:"offer_coin"` // Coin being offered
	AskDenom  string         `json:"ask_denom" yaml:"ask_denom"`   // Denom of the coin to swap to
}
```

### MsgSwapSend

A `MsgSwapSend` first swaps `OfferCoin` for `AskDenom` and then sends the acquired coins to `ToAddress`. Swap fees are charged to the sender.

```go
type MsgSwapSend struct {
	FromAddress sdk.AccAddress `json:"from_address" yaml:"from_address"` // Address of the offer coin payer
	ToAddress   sdk.AccAddress `json:"to_address" yaml:"to_address"`     // Address of the recipient
	OfferCoin   sdk.Coin       `json:"offer_coin" yaml:"offer_coin"`     // Coin being offered
	AskDenom    string         `json:"ask_denom" yaml:"ask_denom"`       // Denom of the coin to swap to
}
```

## Functions

The market module swap functions can be found in x/market/keeper/swap.go


### `ComputeSwap`

[View in Github](https://github.com/terra-money/core/blob/main/x/market/keeper/swap.go#L52)

```go
func (k Keeper) ComputeSwap(ctx sdk.Context, offerCoin sdk.Coin, askDenom string) (retDecCoin sdk.DecCoin, spread sdk.Dec, err error)
```

The `ComputeSwap()` function computes the ask amount based on the offer amount based on the oracle exchange rate and applies a Tobin tax or spread fee. 

1. If both the ask and offer coins are the same denomination, return an error. 

2. Use `ComputeInternalSwap` to swap the offer coin amount to the base µSDR denomination for simplicity. 

3. Use `ComputeInternalSwap` again to return the ask coin amount based on the oracle exchange rate. 

4. For swaps between Terra stablecoins, return the Tobin tax rates for both denominations and apply the higher rate. 

5. For swaps between Terra and Luna, calculate and apply the spread fee. If the spread fee is less than 0.5%, apply the minimum spread fee. 

::: {note}
`k.ComputeSwap()` uses `k.ComputeInternalSwap()` internally to calcuate exchange rates based on the oracle price. `k.ComputeInternalSwap()` does not apply a spread fee. 
:::

### `ComputeInternalSwap`

[View in Github](https://github.com/terra-money/core/blob/main/x/market/keeper/swap.go#L134)

``` go
func (k Keeper) ComputeInternalSwap(ctx sdk.Context, offerCoin sdk.DecCoin, askDenom string) (sdk.DecCoin, error)
```

`K.ComputeInternalSwap()` swaps amounts based on oracle exchange rates without applying a spread fee. 
 
1. If both the ask and offer coins are the same denomination, return an error. 

2. Use [`k.OracleKeeper.GetLunaExchangeRate`](https://github.com/terra-money/core/blob/a048b26251a37d52d7139a6529358ffb95e14b6a/x/oracle/keeper/keeper.go#L71) to return the offer and ask rates from the oracle. All oracle exchange rates are denominated as an amount of Terra stablecoins per Luna. If the offer or ask coins are denominated in Luna, the rate is $1$, as $ 1\, \tfrac{Luna}{Luna} = 1$. 

3. Calculate the ask amount using the offer amount using the following equation:

$$ askAmount = offerCoin.Amount * askRate \div{offerRate} $$


**Example**: Luna to Terra: Swap 20 Luna to SDR:

$offerCoin.Amount$: 20 Luna  
$askRate$: 100 SDR/Luna  
$offerRate$: 1  (1 Luna / 1 Luna)  

$$ \mathrm{20 \,Luna * 100\, \tfrac{SDR}{Luna} \div{1}  = 2000 \,SDR} $$

**Example**: Terra to Terra: Swap 100 USD to SDR:

$offerCoin.Amount$: 100 USD  
$askRate$: 100 SDR/Luna  
$offerRate$: 140 USD/Luna

$$ \mathrm{100 \,USD * 100\, \tfrac{SDR}{Luna} \div{140\, \tfrac{USD}{Luna}}  \approx 71.43 \,SDR} $$

:::{admonition} Micro-denominaitons
The market module uses micro-denominations in all coin calculations. For simplicity, the previous examples show whole values of coins. Micro denominations are one millionth of a coin. 
:::

### `ApplySwapToPool`

[View in Github](https://github.com/terra-money/core/blob/main/x/market/keeper/swap.go#L12)

```go
func (k Keeper) ApplySwapToPool(ctx sdk.Context, offerCoin sdk.Coin, askCoin sdk.DecCoin)
```

`k.ApplySwapToPools()` updates the `terraPoolDelta` during each swap using the offer and ask amounts. 

1. Because all Terra stablecoins share the same virtual liquidity liquidity pool, the `TerraPoolDelta` remains unaltered during swaps between Terra denominations.

2. Use `k.GetTerraPoolDelta` to return the current `terraPoolDelta`. 

3. For Terra to Luna swaps, use [`ComputeInternalSwap`](#computeinternalswap) to swap the offer amount to µSDR. This amount is added to the `terraPoolDelta` to calculate the new `terraPoolDelta`.

$$ \mathrm{newTerraPoolDelta = terraPoolDelta + offerCoin.Amount} $$

4. For Luna to Terra swaps, use [`ComputeInternalSwap`](#computeinternalswap) to swap the ask amount to µSDR. This amount is subtracted from the `terraPoolDelta` to calculate the new `terraPoolDelta`.

$$ \mathrm{newTerraPoolDelta = TerraPoolDelta - askBaseCoin.Amount} $$



For Terra<>Luna swaps, the relative sizes of the pools will be different after the swap, and $\delta$ will be updated with the following formulas:

- for Terra to Luna, $\delta' = \delta + Offer_{\mu SDR}$
- for Luna to Terra, $\delta' = \delta - Ask_{\mu SDR}$


## End-Block

The Market module calls `k.ReplenishPools()` at the end of every block, which decreases the value of `TerraPoolDelta` (the difference between Terra and Luna pools) depending on `PoolRecoveryPeriod`, $pr$.

This allows the network to sharply increase spread fees during acute price fluctuations. After some time, the spread automatically returns to normal for long-term price changes.

## Parameters

The subspace for the Market module is `market`.

```go
type Params struct {
	PoolRecoveryPeriod int64   `json:"pool_recovery_period" yaml:"pool_recovery_period"`
	BasePool           sdk.Dec `json:"base_pool" yaml:"base_pool"`
	MinSpread          sdk.Dec `json:"min_spread" yaml:"min_spread"`
	TobinTax           sdk.Dec `json:"tobin_tax" yaml:"tobin_tax"`
}
```

### PoolRecoveryPeriod

- type: `int64`
- default: `BlocksPerDay`

The number of blocks it takes for the Terra & Luna pools to naturally "reset" toward equilibrium ($\delta \to 0$) through automated pool replenishing.

### BasePool

- type: `Dec`
- default: 250,000 SDR (= 250,000,000,000 µSDR)

The initial starting size of both Terra and Luna liquidity pools.

### MinSpread

- type: `Dec`
- default: 0.5%

The minimum spread charged on Terra<>Luna swaps to prevent leaking value from front-running attacks.

### TobinTax

- type: `Dec`
- default: 0.35%

An additional fee for swapping between Terra currencies (spot-trading). The rate varies, depending on the denomination. For example, while the rate for most denominations is .35%, the rate for MNT is 2%. To see the rates, [query the oracle](https://lcd.terra.dev/terra/oracle/v1beta1/denoms/tobin_taxes).
